## Nix OS Dotfiles
These files track the state of my Nix OS system which is unmanaged by Nix. Notable programs configured here include:

- Emacs
- Neovim
- Zsh

My aliases and shell scripts live here as well.

Note: If and when [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) becomes production ready, these files will probably get migrated to it at some point.
